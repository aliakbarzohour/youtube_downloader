## Download video from YouTube with Python!
<p align='center'>

It occurred to me to start a mini fan project, so I searched and looked for fan projects for Python, and what caught my eye was 'download video from youtube'. I first tried to code myself without seeing the ready-made code, so I searched again and looked for the tool, and the first option that came up in Google was the pytube library. . .
With this library, you can download videos on YouTube (there may be other uses, but programmers usually use YouTube to download).

    Note: You can not download with Iran Internet, because it is filtered. You can use a proxy. . .

After finishing the project, I searched and saw that an Indian programmer introduced the 'proxy' library, which creates a proxy for you, and you can use it in such projects.
